This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.

Sources for tracker:
https://svn.broadinstitute.org/BTL/tracker

To build tracker:
- Checkout source
- Make sure needed libraries from BTL are published locally (see build.sbt for libraries needed):
  o Checkout sources
  o sbt
  o project <projectName>
  o publish-local
- sbt dist

To run tracker (on btllims):
- Copy zip file created in target/universal via "sbt dist" over to /btl/prod/tracker
- unzip the file
- modify /btl/prod/tracker/tracker to point to the new distribution
- kill the old tracker running
- run /btl/prod/tracker/tracker

To run beta tracker (on btllims):
- Copy zip file created in target/universal via "sbt dist" over to /btl/prod/tracker
- unzip the file
- modify the name of the top level unzipped directory to tracker-beta
- kill the old beta tracker running
- run /btl/prod/tracker/trackerBeta

Note that if you are installing a new production tracker and beta tracker at the same time you must first
install the beta tracker and then the production tracker to prevent renaming the distribution directory (e.g., you
want to unzip, rename the unzipped directory to be trackerBeta and then unzip again to create the non-beta tracker)

Finally, it's best to do the installing via a sudo as btladm so that others can do a reinstall (only user starting
jobs can kill them)

If you need to restart mongo (tracker uses 2.6.11):
/btl/prod/apps/mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.6.11/bin/mongoStart
For MD which uses 3.2.10 do:
/btl/prod/apps/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.2.10/bin/mongoStart
