#TODO: Refactoring for consumption of barcodes in the database
1. Create or modify code to have a DBBarcodeWell class with signature of location, i5 (Option[Name]) and i7 Option[Name]
and extends DBOpers.
2. Create or modify code to have a DBBarcodeSet that extends DBOpers and has a setname and contents which is a set of barcode wells. It should also
have functions for talking to the database directly.
3. Create or modify code to have BarcodeWell class which DOES NOT see the database but essentially acts as a proxy object and rather
than contain Option[Name] it should contain the Barcode object itself.
4. Create or modify code to have a BarcodeSet class that has a name, and contents like DBBarcodeSet but also getters and setters
that are public and call DBBarcodeSet's getters and setters.

-The guys that talk to DB directly should be hidden as much as possible.
