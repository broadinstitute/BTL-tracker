# STEP 1

Wrangle excel data into scala code that defines p5 & p7 barcodes.
Must make sure that barcode doesn't already exist in code by
comparing hobbit names. 
Can use excel techniques used for low input metagenomic workflow.

# Step 2
Wrangle more excel into scala code for the map of barcodes. 

# Step 3

Define variable defining the process. Update molBarcodes list, 
validDivisions list, and contents map in IntiialContenst.scala.
